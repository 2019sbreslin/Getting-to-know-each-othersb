<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> I am a sophomore at Lewis University and I’m on the women’s golf team. I’m also from the very Southern tip of Illinois and have a twin sister. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Peace Studies.</p>

<h5>”My Favorite Hobby”</h5>
<p> I would say my favorite hobby is playing golf and hanging out with my friends. I have been playing golf since I was little and went to the driving range with my dad all the time. Golf is the main reason why I chose to attend this school and I’m so grateful for the opportunity to continue to play the sport I love. Both at school and home, I have an amazing group of friends and doing things with them is what I enjoy doing in my free time.</p>

<h7> "Fun Fact" </h7>
<p>One time I gave myself a black eye from running into a door and told everyone it was from basketball practice.</p>
